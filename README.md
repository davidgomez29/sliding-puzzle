#Sliding Puzzle With jQuery and jQuery UI
Remember as a kid, the cheap, plastic sliding puzzles? They had a grid of sliding squares (usually imprinted with numbers on each square). One square was missing, so that all the others could be moved around, one square at a time. The goal was to put the squares back in numerical order.

This type of puzzle can be emulated in a web browser with a simple use of jQuery and jQueryUI.
